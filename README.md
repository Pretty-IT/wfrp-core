## Local build
### Unix
Use `make lib` for `.so` library (and `.h` header) or `make exec` for executable file. Results will be in `build/` directory.

### Windows
Need instruction. Useful links:

## How to use
### Create new endpoint
Need instruction. For now, just use `Hello world` sample in `export.go` and `api.go` files.

### Use as executable
You can build a scenario from api calls in `main.go` file, build it as executable and run it.
